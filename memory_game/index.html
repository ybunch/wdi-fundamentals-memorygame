Open up the index.html and style.css pages in the memory_game folder in Sublime Text.

Now let's add a footer.

In the index.html file, after the main element, add a footer element.

Add a paragraph inside the footer and give it the class copyright.

Place the following content in the paragraph:
Copyright 2017
Add a second paragraph inside the footer and give it the class message.

Place the following content in the paragraph:
Created with &hearts; by <span class="name">GA</span>


Now let's add some styles to the footer!

Check your work after each step! To do so, open the index.html file in Sublime Text, right click, and then select "Open in Browser".

Apply the following styles to the footer in your style.css file:

Make the text uppercase.

Add 20px padding on the right and left sides.

Give it a background color of #0D2C40.

The text color should be white.

The font size should be 14px.

Give it a letter spacing of .08em.

The font weight should be 500.


Alright, now let's add some styles to the two paragraphs in the footer. We can target each paragraph in our CSS file using the class names we added in our HTML â€” .copyright and .message.

Each paragraph should be displayed using the "Raleway" font family.

Float .copyright to the left.

Float .message to the right.

If you reload the page in your browser, you'll probably notice that our footer background is all off now that we're floating the content inside! Let's fix this using the clearfix method.

Add the following code to your style.css file:
.clearfix:after {
visibility: hidden;
display: block;
content: " ";
clear: both;
height: 0;
font-size: 0;
}
Then give the footer the class clearfix in your index.html file.


Let's add some flair to the word GA in the footer. In your html, you'll notice that it's wrapped with a span that has the class name.

Select .name in your style.css file and give it a color of #F15B31 and a font weight of 700.
Finally, let's add a hover effect to the anchors in the nav.

In your style.css file, give all anchors the following style: border-bottom: 2px solid transparent;

Then add another, separate rule to style all anchors when the user hovers over them.

When the user hovers over them, change the border color to white.

a:hover {
/* Your styles here */
}
